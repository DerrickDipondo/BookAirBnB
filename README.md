# eHome (Monolithic Version)

This repository contains the original **monolithic** implementation of *eHome*, an online travel platform where users can browse, book, and manage property listings.

### 🏗️ Project Overview
- Built as a monolith with a single Flask backend and a React frontend.
- Demonstrates core functionality including:
  - User authentication
  - Property listing and booking
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Initial database and routing logic

### 🚧 Status
This version served as the **starting point** for building and validating core business logic and UI flow.

> ⚠️ The project has since been **refactored into a microservice architecture** for scalability and maintainability.
